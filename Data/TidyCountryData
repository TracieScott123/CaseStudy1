# Prepare dateset by 
#      removing unneeded rows with summary data as indicated by blank or missing IncomeGroup
#      remove uneeded columns (this dataset has a large number of columns not used by this research effort)
#      Seperate IncomeGroupOCED into new IncomeGroup and OCEDStatus so values can be used in analysis
#
# CountryTidy variables will be:
#      CountryCode - Character - Three letter country code (used to merge data with GDP information)
#      ShortName   - Character - Informal abbreviated or shortened name for the country, may be helpful with charts
#      IncomeGroup - Character - Indicates relative level of income, inclucding OCED status (OCED or nonOCED)
#      LongName    - Character - Formal Full name for the country
#      Region      - Character - Region name (may not be  used, but could be handy, so retained)
# Note: Other variables will be excluded; not relevant to this  research
#
# Create a temporary table eliminating rows containing summary data (Income.Group is missing)
ValidRows<-CountryData[!is.na(CountryData$Income.Group),]
# Reduce columns to those likely to use for analysis
CountryTidy <-ValidRows[,c(1,31,3,2,4)]
# Asign better variable names
names(CountryTidy)<-c("CountryCode", "ShortName", "IncomeGroup", "LongName", "Region")
dim(CountryTidy)
