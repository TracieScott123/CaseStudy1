## Finalize the data set for analysis
# GDPDataTidy - Containing only valid rows of country information as indicted by capital letters in column 1
#             - convert rankings from a factor to continueous numeric values
#             - convert GDP value from a factor wtih embedded commas to a continuous numberic value
#             - Containing only necessary columns 1,2,4,5,6 (other columns are not needed and contain mostly missing values)
#       Variables will be:
#       CountryCode - Character - Three letter country code
#       Ranking     - Numeric   - Rank of GDP, starting with 1
#                                 Largest GDP has smallest rank number
#                                 Missing rank means GSP was not available
#                                 Set missing values for countries to 199 to help seperate country data from rows reporting summary data
#       CountryGDP  - Character - Name for the geographic area related to GDP provided
#                                 May not actually be a recognized country
#       MillionsUSD  - Numveric - Value providing the Gross Domestic Product for the country in equivalient US dollars, in millions
#                                 Missing values means the data was not available
#       FootNote    - character value relating that country to notes in the original file
#
# Create a temporary table with rows containing three-letter country codes
ValidRows<-GDPdata[grep("^[A-Z]",GDPdata$X),]
#
# Convert coerced factors to numeric data for Ranking and MillionsUSD
ValidRows$Ranking<-as.numeric(as.character(ValidRows$Gross.domestic.product.2012))
ValidRows$MillionsUS<-as.numeric(gsub(",", "", ValidRows$X.3))
#
# Reduce columns to those likely to use for analysis
ValidCol <-ValidRows[,c(1,11,4,12,6)]
#
# Asign better variable names
names(ValidCol)<-c("CountryCode", "Ranking", "CountryGDP", "MillionsUSD", "Footnote")
#
#
# Create simple plots to look for obvious issues with the data
plot(x=ValidCol$CountryCode, y=ValidCol$MillionsUSD)
plot(x=ValidCol$Ranking, y=ValidCol$MillionsUSD)
#
# RAnked data looks reasonable. Evidence of outliers in unranked data, Perhaps as a result of missing datavalues. 
# Numerica values are required for analysis. Count missing values then remove rows with missing values from final # # # dataset. Recheck plots.
#
sum(is.na(ValidCol$Ranking))
# Note: There are 38 missing values for Ranking.
sum(is.na(ValidCol$MillionsUSD))
# Note: There are 24 missing values for GDP value MillionsGDP
