# Answer B- The 13th country is Azerbajan AZE
#
# What is the average ranking for High Income: OECD  and High:Income: non-OECD countries?

#
# Answer D - plot CountryCode by Country GDP in Millions, color by Income Group
ggplot(SortedCountryGDP, aes(y=SortedCountryGDP$MillionsUSD, x=SortedCountryGDP$CountryCode, color=SortedCountryGDP$IncomeGroup )) + geom_point()
#
#Add a variable for quartile
SortedCountryGDP$quartile <- ntile(SortedCountryGDP$MillionsUSD, 5) 
#create a Table representing the Quartiles by MillionsUSD and IncomeGroup
table(SortedCountryGDP$quartile, SortedCountryGDP$IncomeGroup)
# Answer E - There are three (3) countries in Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest GDP
